# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of the o-factor project community and want every contributor to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all contributors are expected to show respect and courtesy to other contributors.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

## Our expectations

We expect all contributors to conform to the following Code of Conduct:

* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Using welcome and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

## Enforcement

**Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.**

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the o-factor project development team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.
